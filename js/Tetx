Data Type
	They describe the characterstics of data


1. Primitive
	Numbers			==> x = 100.30;	or	x = 20;
	Strings			==> "Bharath0101"
	Boolean			==> True or False
	Null			==> x = null, x has empty value or no value (still still has memory)
	Undefined		==> x = undefined

	Declaration:	var x;
					doesn't have any memory allocated to the variable

	Definition: 	var x=null or x = 10 or x = 20.3 or x= "something";
					do have memory allocated to the variable


	a. Primitive types are immutable (not changable) ==> we cannot modify it
	b. We can compare the values of data
		let x = 20;
		let y = 30;
		let x = "Good";
		let y = "Bad";
		if (x==y)	==> we can compare


	Numbers
		Can be integer or decimal (float)
		We can perform all mathemmatical operations


	Strings
		















2. Non-Primitive
	Objects
	Functions
	Arrays
