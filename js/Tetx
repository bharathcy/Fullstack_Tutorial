		alerts, msgbox, prompts
	2. console.log
	3. innerHTML, innerText
	4. Document.write()


Data Type
	They describe the characterstics of data


1. Primitive
	Numbers			==> x = 100.30;	or	x = 20;
	Strings			==> "Bharath0101"

	Boolean			==> true or false

						All the numbers whether +ve or -ve ==> true
						But Zero ==> false

						All the sting with some length ==> true
						if zero length ==> false
						

						Falsy Values
							undefined
							0
							null
							NaN
							false
							''
							""
							``

							console.log(z)

	Null			==> x = null, x has empty value or no value (still has memory)
	Undefined		==> x = undefined

	Declaration:	var x;
					doesn't have any memory allocated to the variable

	Definition: 	var x=null or x = 10 or x = 20.3 or x= "something";
					do have memory allocated to the variable


	a. Primitive types are immutable (not changable) ==> we cannot modify it
	b. We can compare the values of data
		let x = 20;
		let y = 30;
		let x = "Good";	==> x[0]
		let y = "Bad";
		if (x==y)	==> we can compare


	Numbers
		Can be integer or decimal (float)
		We can perform all mathemmatical operations


	Strings
		Text with in a single quote or a double quote in js
		'Bharath' or "Bharath" or `Bharath`

		


		x = "something"	==> Address x 20004000	s
									  20004001	o
									  20004002	m
									  20004003	e
									  20004004	t
